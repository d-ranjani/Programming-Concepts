Code:
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

num=1
i=0
number = False

while(1) : 
    for i in range (2,21,1):
        if(num%i!=0):
            break
        if(i==20):
            print "The smallest positive number divisible from 1 to 20 is : " + str(num)
            number = True
    num = num+1  
    if(number==True):
        break  


OUTPUT:

The smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20 232792560
