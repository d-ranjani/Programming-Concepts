import math

def sum_of_squares(n):
    sum=math.pow((n*(n+1)/2),2)
    return sum 

def square_of_sum(n):
    square=(n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6
    return square
print "The difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum"
print sum_of_squares(100)-square_of_sum(100)

OUTPUT:
The difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum
