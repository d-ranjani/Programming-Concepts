Code:

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

def is_pal(c):
    return int(str(c)[::-1]) == c

maxpal = 0
for a in range(100, 999, 1):
    for b in range(a, 999,1):
        prod = a * b
        if is_pal(prod) and prod > maxpal:
            maxpal = prod

print maxpal

OUTPUT:

Largest Palindrome Made from the product of 3-digit number are
906609
